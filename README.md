# PSBA-Manila

Customized WordPress Theme for PSBA-Manila.

For development, do `npm install` first, and then `npm run dev` or `npm run watch` for changes.

For production use, make sure to delete `node_modules` and any `.git` directory inside the `vendor` folder. The default js/css files are compiled using `npm run production`, so make sure to recompile using that command after `npm install` if you made changes.

## Plugin Requirements

This requires CMB2/CMB2. Place it on this folder's wp-content/plugins if it is not included in your plugins for development.
